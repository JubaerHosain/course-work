The modularity means that the logical components of a large program can each be implemented separately.
Different people can work on different classes. Each implementation task is isolated from the others.


Modularity is the process of decomposing a problem (program) into a set of modules so as to
reduce the overall complexity of the problem. Booch has defined modularity as −

“Modularity is the property of a system that has been decomposed into
a set of cohesive and loosely coupled modules.”

implementation is through packages in java.
