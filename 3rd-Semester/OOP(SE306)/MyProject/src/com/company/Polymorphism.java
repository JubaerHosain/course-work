//SuperClass object = new SubClass(); is a polymorphism
//method overriding
//method overloading

//You may have a method that only takes an instance of SuperClass. Since SubClass is a SuperClass,
// you can use an instance of SubClass and treat it as SuperClass.

//The same behavior is used when working with interfaces:

// List someList = new ArrayList();
//That's the beauty of polymorphism. It allows you to change out the implementation of the class'
// internals without breaking the rest of your code.
